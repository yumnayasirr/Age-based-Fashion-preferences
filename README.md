Project Overview
The project investigates how different age groups adapt to fashion trends, using data mining techniques to classify individuals based on their style changes.

Given survey responses and collected fashion data, the objective is to classify individuals into one of the following categories:

No Change
Changed a Little
Changed Significantly

This is a multi-class classification problem that leverages machine learning models to predict how individuals' fashion preferences evolve over time.

Dataset
The dataset consists of survey responses collected through Google Forms, WhatsApp, LinkedIn, and in-person interviews at shopping malls. The key attributes include:

Age Group (Under 18, 18-24, 25-34, etc.)

Style Change (No change, Changed a little, Changed significantly)

Influencing Factors (Social media, Peer influence, Cultural norms, Income level)

Brand Preferences (Local brands, International brands, Mixed preferences)

**Models Implemented**

Several classification models were applied to predict style change trends:

Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Decision Tree

**Results**

Decision Tree outperformed SVM in accuracy and interpretability.

SVM struggled with minority classes due to dataset imbalance.

Future improvements may include ensemble methods (Random Forest, XGBoost) and deeper feature engineering.

**Future Work**

Implement Random Forest and Gradient Boosting models for improved performance.

Apply advanced feature engineering to enhance model accuracy.

Conduct further surveys to expand the dataset for better generalization.
